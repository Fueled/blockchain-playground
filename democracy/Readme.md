# Democracy EOS Smart Contract

Simple example of the usual ETH in a EOS smart contract.

## Requirements

- [eosiocpp](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Programs-&-Tools#eosiocpp)



## Deploying

To push the contract onto the EOS blockchain we have to do the following things:

- [Allocate Wallet Address](#setting-up-eos-wallet)
- [Run deploy script](#generate-webassembly-file)

You can use a simple script in contracts called `deploy_contract.sh` that will 


### Deploy script
We've created a quick deploy script that does the following steps:
- Creates the WebAssembly file
- Creates the ABI file
- Deploys contract with given account

**Usage:**

In the root folder of the project, run:

```
./contracts/deploy_contract.sh <ACCOUNT> <CONTRACT>
```

This script assumes the following contract structure, lets say we have `HelloWorld`:
```
contracts/
    HelloWorld/
        HelloWorld.cpp
        Helloworld.hpp

    deploy_contract.sh
```

## Setting up EOS wallet

In order to deploy a contract you will have to push the code onto an account. This account is created with your public key you created through `cleos`.

To get a new public key you simply run:
```
cleos create key
```

This will give you a Public and Private key, note that *only the public key is shared* and is used to create your wallet. From there, verification is done with your Private key you have locally.

A small indicator that distinct these two keys is that the public key starts with the `EOS` prefix.

### Structure of Wallets and Accounts
Similar to other Distributed Apps Blockchain networks such as Ethereum the EOS blockchain uses Wallets to store your assets and sending and receiving transactions. It uses a client called `cleos` to sign your transactions and keeps your private keys safe by encryption.

The difference of EOS and Ethereum is that EOS goes a little further and associates Accounts to these Wallets. An account is a human readable identifier that is stored on the blockchain. These accounts on itself can have specific permissions that are validated upon the transaction to see if this account is permissioned to do so.

```
- Wallet 1 <Public/Secret Key>
    - Account laura
        - Permission read
        - Permission custom_permission
    - Account paul
        - Permission write
        - Permission read

- Wallet 2 <Public/Secret Key>
    - Account henk
    - Account julien
```

### Creating your account
When you retrieved your public key you can start creating an account. These accounts are identified with a name that you can choose, note that the name does not contain any spaces.

Before you can create an account with a specific Public key, make sure that you have imported the private key inside Cleos:
```
cleos create key

>> Private Key: ...
>> Public Key: EOS...
```
```
cleos import <Private key>
```

```
cleos create account eosio hello.code <OWNER PUBLIC KEY> <YOUR PUBLIC KEY>
```

*Note the `PUBLIC OWNER KEY`*: Accounts can be created as sort of a `subaccount`, this basically gives the `owner` certain permissions to control the transactions of that sub account.




# Notes


## Understanding EOS Smart contract

- Smart contracts are written in C++
- Smart Contracts is bascially a class, inheriting the EOSIO `contract` class

- Creating an ABI
	- `eosiocpp` can read through annotations and use it to generate ABI functions
	- These comments can only be read through with the double shash `//` format
	- You can persist mutliple `@abi` in front of the annotation to generate multiple naming in the ABI
		- The `@abi` annotation accepts the type of abi definition is as the first argument, e.g. `action` or `table`
			- the `table` type accepts 2 *optional* parameters, first is possibly a different table name and second one is the type of indexing you want (optional), such as `i64`, make sure to have an `id` property on your struct.
	- `_self` is used globally inside the contract as the contract instance
	- `multi_index` is scoped by the `contract` on initiation


- Database thoughts
	- `emplace` is creating a new item inside the table
	- `multi_index` is indexed by `primary_key()` method in struct, which in itself returns the field to be indexed and unique by
	- Querying the database is done by the `.find` method of the `multi_index` database property
		- `auto iter = table_name.find(YourPrimaryKeyValue)`
		- Updating these rows in the iteration value is done by referencing back the table instance (e.g. `table_name`) and passing the iteration as argument ```table_name.modify(iter, 0, [&]( auto& row) {
               // Do your changes here
              row.value = "New Value"
            });)```

    - `struct` needs to have the `EOSLIB_SERIALIZE` macro to assign what fields have to be serialized in the database
    	- Format is `EOSLIB_SERIALIZE(N(table_name), (field1)(field2)(field3))`
    - `N()` is a macro to `eosio::string_to_name` method that basically takes a string and returns back a 64 bit integer.

    - Use the `available_primary_key` method when you have `i64` setup as `id`


### Generate WebAssembly file

To generate Wast file you can run the following command:
```
eosiocpp -o hello.wast hello.cpp
```

### Generate ABI

In order to push to the blockchain we create an Application Binary Interface, which is a json file that maps your actions and data structures.

# Exploring eosio::multi_index
The EOS platform is still pretty new, we have been trying to find any information on the EOS platform, let alone specifically on the Database API the EOS platform provides. For now we have only found [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbWDHrm2ETY) to be the most insightful.

This gave us the task and opportunity to just figure it out by digging through the actual EOS source code. We laid out what we have figured out by reading, so that you don't need to (hopefully).

The EOS software uses smart contracts itself to persist data about [RAM usage](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosio.system/delegate_bandwidth.cpp) (more about it later) and has some good examples [(1)](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosio.system/voting.cpp) [(2)](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/tic_tac_toe/tic_tac_toe.cpp) [(3)](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/blob/master/contracts/eosio.token/eosio.token.cpp) we were able to use, here's our result. 

## Intro into EOS database

The EOS database is a special feature that enabled you to store indexed data into the blockchain out of data structures. Under the hood EOS heavily relied on the design of the Boost library Database API. Having the database on the blockchain. does not mean everyone has right to do write/read on this database. The EOS database is basically build into multiple layers, as it is described in `contracts/eosiolib/db.h` has a simple idea:

```
 *  EOS.IO organizes data according to the following broad structure:
 *
 *  - **code** - the account name which has write permission
 *     - **scope** - an account where the data is stored
 *        - **table** - a name for the table that is being stored
 *           - **record** - a row in the table
```

There are some terms used here that can deceive you, here I laid out what these terms mean.
- `code` is a number that correspondents to your contract code. You might have seen it before with building out smart contracts on EOS, it is the "identifier" of the smart contract.
- `scope` Because the contract can be deployed multiple times the contract identifier is not suffice. The scope can be anything, but usually it is the account identifier which it is deployed with.
- `table` The name of the table
- `record` Hopefully that speaks for itself

### EOS Database = uint64_t


### Structuring your tables
The EOS database tables can be formatted by `struct` data type, in these structures you are able to define the naming and type definition of your properties of that table.

Let's look at an example:

```cpp
// @abi table proposal i64
struct Proposal {
  uint64_t id;
  account_name owner = 0;
  string description;
  std::vector<Ballot> votes;

  uint64_t primary_key() const { return id; }

  EOSLIB_SERIALIZE( Proposal, (id)(owner)(description)(votes))
};


typedef eosio::multi_index<N(Proposal), Proposal> proposals;

```

So let's go through the parts of the code and highlight some of the requirements EOS has defined.

```cpp
// @abi table proposal i64
```

For deploying your contract, you will run the code through the `eosiocpp` command, the EOS Smart Contract compiler is able to read out the comments above your `struct` and public functions. AFAIK there are 2 main types for these commands: `action` and `table`, which speak for itself. This comment annotation notifies the compiler to add this method or table definition into the ABI output. 

The second argument "proposal" is to give you an option for a different table name. The last one is to define a type of table you want to use, for now it seems like there is only a version for `i64`, which stands for a 64 bit indexed table.

```cpp
account_name owner = 0
```

The EOSIO package comes with a custom type definition for storing the account name reference, this is the account you create on your own local EOS wallet.

```cpp
std::vector<Ballot> votes;
```


```cpp
uint64_t primary_key() const { return id; }
```
In order to work with the `eosio::multi_index` table we need to define a primary key for the database functionality to search and index on. This is required and can be done by creating a `primary_key` method on your `struct`. This example shows us casting it to a `uint64_t`, but this can also be `account_name` (which, ironically, is a `uint64_t` in disguise).


```cpp
EOSLIB_SERIALIZE( <StructName>, (field1)(field2)(field3))
```
I was always wondering what this specifically meant in the EOS Contract Examples. Knowing it was definitely a macro I started to go through the code and get to know the system better. By digging deep, I came to read through the `contracts/eosiolib/serialize.hpp` and found that it was using the `BOOST_PP_SEQ_FOR_EACH` macro.


### Creating child lists
The EOS database structure is able to hold lists members (vectors) inside its data structures. This helps a lot in grouping and organizing your code for reducing querying to the data source.


### Querying your data
The EOS Multi Index database comes with some functionality to retrieve back the information. Although the features are not as extensive as something like a SQL Query, but it does its basics:

- Querying an entry with `.find`
- Creating new entries with `.emplace`
- Modifying existing entries with `.modify`
- Retrieving a new `primary_key` value through `.available_primary_key`

### Retrieving items
For retrieving a record by its primary key we simply run:
```
proposals.find(proposal_id)
```

**Under the hood**
This will simply run the `std::find_if` functionality that checks if the looped item has the correct primary key:

```
ptr._item->primary_key() == input_primary
```

#### Creating new items

In order for your to create a new item, you can use the `.emplace` method coming from the `multi_index` class. The following arguments are used:

```cpp
emplace( uint64_t payer, Lambda&& constructor )
```

As you can see the first argument is called the `payer`. Every interaction with EOS, just like with ETH transaction there is somebody responsible for "paying" for storage.

An example insertion could be:
```cpp
auto new_proposal = proposals.emplace( _self, [&]( auto& proposal) {
    proposal.id = proposals.available_primary_key();
    proposal.owner = sender;
    proposal.description = description;
});
```

As you can see the `emplace` method second argument is a lambda function where you will get an allocated data structure `Proposal` reference which you then can persist your information on.


#### Modifying items
To modify an object you can use the `.modify` method, the arguments this method accepts are:
```cpp
modify( const T& obj, uint64_t payer, Lambda&& updater )
```

Again we can see the `payer` and `Lambda` method, just like in our `.emplace` method. The first argument did change, this is now the reference object you would like to change. This means that we first need to *retrieve the element before we can modify it*.

An example could be:
```cpp
auto iter = proposals.find(proposal_id); 

// assert basically checks if iteration is at the end, meaning there is
// no value
eosio_assert(iter != proposals.end(), "Could not find proposal");

proposals.modify( iter, 0, [&]( auto& proposal) {
  proposal.description = "New value"
});
```




## Understanding Storage Costs
The blockchain and decentralization is a great stray, but there is still somebody that needs to pay for storage and bandwidth. Having a decantralized application does not mean storage is free, as every blockchain software tries to solve this problem, Ethereum asks for example something called the "gas price", EOS takes a different approach on this. 

Instead of asking for transaction costs aka a gas price, EOS determines how much you can store by the *amount of tokens you hold*. The EOS has a token contract inside its functionality. This token contact is similar to a `ERC20` contract you would find with these (sometimes sketchy (looking at you EOS (yes you))).
